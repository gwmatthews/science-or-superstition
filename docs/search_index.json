["about-this-book.html", "about this book", " about this book This book is a collection of readings and other resources for use in the Science or Superstition course I teach at Plymouth State University. This version is a result of a long process of writing, redoing and revision which began a number of years ago on various blogging platforms (B2evolution and then WordPress) and has steadily been moving towards a simpler version less dependant on all of the bells and whistles of dynamically generated web pages towards cleaner and faster to load static webpages. This version is, I hope, easier to use (and maintain) as well as less prone to technical difficulties. There are no databases, no third party plugins and much less overhead. It is hosted on GitHub pages and the source code is available in its repository in case anyone wants to use it for their own purposes.

["essentials.html", "Essentials", " Essentials Welcome to the readings and resources site for Science or Superstition taught by George Matthews at Plymouth State University. All readings and assignments can be found here as well as a calendar to help keep you organized and up to date on what is going on in the course. I hope you find this website easy to use and a helpful tool for getting the most out of this course. There are a couple of things to note about this site: There is a toolbar at the top of the page that enables you to expand or collapse the table of contents on the side, search for any keywords you like in the whole site, or change the color theme to make it easier on your eyes than the default stark white screen. You may also have noticed some icons in the top right corner pf the screen. This is the Hypothes.is tool which is embedded in this website so you can highlight parts of the text, or add comments to parts of the text or the whole page. We’ll be going over how to use Hypothes.is in class, but there is also a tutorial in the appendix at the end of the book. "],

["assignments.html", "Assignments", " Assignments Blog posts This course makes use of two websites, this one and a WordPress blog hosted by Plymouth State University which can be found here or by following the link at the top of the table of contents or on the course page at MyPlymouth. The blog is the place where everyone who is a student in the two sections of this class will write and post original articles related to the subject matter of this course. The assignment for your blog posts is simple: You can write about whatever you like as long as it is interesting and relevant, and that is up to you to decide. Everyone in the course will write three posts over the course of the semester according to the schedule described below. Each post should be your original work, and not Ctrl+c, Ctrl+v plagiarism. The point is to reflect on what we are doing in the course on your own terms and in your own voices. Each post should be in the range of 500 - 750 words and can include media such as images, videos and so on as well as links to external articles or websites. Please give credit to image sources and use images that are licensed for reuse. Pixabay and Wiki-media Commons are great sources. Your posts should look good and be fun to read – style counts! See the grading guidelines for information on how these posts will be graded. Posting Schedule Everyone in the course will be randomly assigned to one of eight different groups. These groups are for three things. 1. They determine when you post – see the calendar for the complete set of dates for every group. You do not need to coordinate with your group, you share a deadline with them that is all. 2. You’ll work with them in class on various assignments like the case studies. 3. You’ll work with them on the Not Quite Science project described below. Annotations with Hypothes.is Hypothes.is is a free tool designed to enable you to take notes on any page out there on the web, organize and find your notes, and engage in discussion with other not takers. We will have a class workshop on how to use it, but for reference there is also a tutorial here. Your assignment is to use this tool to make notes on any two pages every week here on this site or linked to from this site as external reading material. Your notes can take the form of “annotations,” where you comment on a particular section of text, “page notes” which connect to the page but not any particular part, or reponses to anyone else’s annotations or page notes. All notes and responses should take place within the SOS@PSU private group and will only by visible by other members of that group which is restricted to me and the people in this course. Case studies There are five case studies that you will work on in class with your groups, one for each of the five sections of this course. All are available here as pdf documents with a short narrative account as well as other information needed to describe the case; and a Google form that you will fill out and submit in class with your group. You are welcome to read the cases ahead of time but that is not necessary. Group project Each group will work together on a longer term project involving the investtigation and critical analysis of some area of “Not Quite Science.” The result will be a longer blog post written by everyone together, but posted by one designated author and a short class presentation of your finding on the day of the final exam.

["powers.html", "Powers of 10", " Powers of 10 This classic video is a great way to start off our explorations of science. It shows in a simple and stark way the vast size of the universe and the relative insignificance of human lives and concerns given this vastness, but it also demonstrates indirectly the power of scientific thinking. Science has enabled us, from our relatively insignificant and limited vantage point, to figure out the overall picture of the whole. Even if there are still may details to be figured out, and even if there is plenty that a scientific perspective must leave out, it is nothing short of astounding to see the sheer scope of scientific knowledge. In a relatively short period of time we have manged to figure out the basic structure of reality in the full range of scales from that of sub-atomic particles, to observable universe as a whole. "],
["what-is.html", "Part 1: What is Science?", " Part 1: What is Science? Some 2400 years ago the Greek philosopher Aristotle defined human beings as “the rational animal.” Since he was someone who spent his life carefully investigating the world around him and laying the foundations for scientific inquiry we can forgive him for being a little optimistic in this definition. It might be better to revise his definition slightly and refer to ourselves as storytelling animals instead. We come into the world equipped with a brain and central nervous system that function as a story telling machine that takes in enormous amounts of information and spontaneously generates stories about what is happening around us, as well as predictions about what will happen next, and plans about how we might influence what is happening to our advantage. Some of these stories it turns out reflect what is really going in around us, but many do not, reflecting instead what we imagine or would like to be happening instead. And in fact, even if Aristotle can lay claim to having laid the foundations for science, it really wasn’t until the developments of the scientific revolution 1500 years after his death that science really took off. Ironically, it was Aristotle’s own theories about the nature of reality and the essential components of rational scientific explanation itself that had to be rejected to really begin developing a successful account of reality and its workings. Science is nothing but a systematic and deliberate effort to distinguish between the stories that reflect the true nature of things and those that do not. It is a way of distinguishing bewteen appearances and reality to put it somewhat dramatically. This course, and the material collected here, is intended as an extended reflection on the way science works, the tools it employs, some important episodes from the history of science, and some of the many ways in which we get lost on our way to knowledge owing to the inner workings of our spontaneous story-telling machines. It tells the story of the origins of science and its methods, and how it might be distinguished from the “undergroth of science” or the almost but not quite scientific accounts that have accompanied the quest for knowledge from the beginning.

["revolution.html", "The scientific revolution", " The scientific revolution The scientific revolution was a far-reaching transformation of our understanding of the natural world as well as a transformation of the methods we could use to gather knowledge about the world. It can be conveniently framed by the publication of two books, even if its roots go further back that the first and it continued long after the second. The first of these is On the revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres written by Nicolas Copernicus and published shortly after his death in 1543. And the second is Isaac Newton’s Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy first published in 1687. Paul Hermans [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons The first of these presented a clear and deliberate argument against the view that the earth is the stable center of the universe with the sun the planets and the stars all orbiting around us. The second articulated a simple set of mathematical laws governing all motion on earth and in the heavens. It made use of the novel mathematical techniques and principles now known as calculus to describe with mathematical precision the continuous change of variables in such phenomena as the orbits of the planets and the motion of projectiles here in earth. These two books represent convenient beginning and end points for a series of developments that transformed our conception of the universe and our place in it. The image below has embedded within it videos and web links to find out more about Copernicus, Newton and many of the other important contributors whose lives and work unfolded between these two. "],

["matter-and-energy.html", "Matter and energy", " Matter and energy In the beginning of the Nineteenth Century, that is after the Scientific Revolution, the scientific understanding of the material world was just getting started. At that point the following questions had not yet been answered: What exactly are material things made of? What causes matter to change form – why do things rust, burn, transform chemically? What explains the mysterious phenomena of electricity and magnetism? What is heat, why do some processes release heat and how can it be harnessed to do interesting things? What is the difference between animate and inanimate things? By the end of the century all of these questions had been answered, even though the details had not yet all been worked out. But not only did this vast increase in knowledge lead to a great understanding of the material world, it was also accompanied by, led to and was helped out by a vast change in human society known as the Industrial Revolution. As compelling evidence of the scope of theses changes consider Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at the beginning and at the end of the century. Before the scientific and technological changes of the Nineteenth Century Pittsburgh was a sleepy frontier town at the confluence of three rivers. View of the City of Pittsburgh in 1817 by Mrs. E. C. Gibson &amp; William Coventry Wall Less than a century later the small frontier town had grown into an industrial city at the heart of the American steel industry. Pittsburgh in 1902 by Thaddeus Mortimer Fowler Underneath this transformation into the world of modern industrial society in which we still all live was a series of scientific developments in the understanding and hence ability to manipulate the material world as never before.

["freedom-and-determinism.html", "Freedom and determinism", " Freedom and determinism Our next philosophical interlude is an exploration of the difficult puzzle of human freedom in a material world. The problem is simple to state and maddeningly difficult to solve. If everything that happens in the material world is caused by physical forces acting according to necessary laws, how can we really do anything freely? Are we not just cogs in some vast machine compelled by the forces acting on us? "],
["science-and-pseudoscience.html", "Science and pseudoscience", " Science and pseudoscience The nineteenth century not only saw the explosive growth of scientific and technical knowledge about the workings of the material world. It also saw the development of modern spiritualism, phrenology (which claimed to be able to determine the character traits of someone based on the shape of their head), the the “science” of human racial types, hypnotism, parapsychology, modern astrology and other not-quite-scientific attempts to provide a scientific basis for a picture of the world that was directly threatened by the materialism implicit in nineteenth century science. What all of these approaches have in common is the attempt to use quasi-scientific methods to validate beliefs that were directly threatened by developments in science. From a philosophical point of view, we are here wandering into the murky waters of the “demarcation problem.” How can we distinguish “real” science from pseudo-scientific impostors, those approaches that claim to be scientific but are really something different? The difficulty of this problem comes from the difficulty of spelling out a series of necessary and sufficient conditions for something being real science, especially since the pretenders to science often argue that their views meet those same criteria. Is this just a matter of turf wars between the establishment and the fringe? Is this really an ideological battle between two different world views one of which claims that all that exists is matter and energy, and the other of which claims that there has to be something more – a soul, a spiritual world, a deeper and hidden meaning to things rather than just atoms in empty space? This article presents the basic question and discusses Karl Popper’s famous solution to the “demarcation problem” which hinges on his idea that the best scientific theories are not the ones that have been somehow proven correct or verified, but the ones that could be but have not yet been falsified. That may seem like a roundabout way of talking but for Popper the crucial difference between legitimate and illegitimate approaches to science is that scientific claims take risks and so tells us something new about reality while pseudosceintific theories do not and hence never get beyond stating what their proponents already think they know. What Is Pseudoscience? Climate deniers are accused of practicing pseudoscience, as are intelligent design creationists, astrologers, UFOlogists, parapsychologists, practitioners of alternative medicine, and often anyone who strays far from the scientific mainstream. Here is another take on the topic by Hank Green from the Crash Course video series. "],
