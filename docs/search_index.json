["about-this-book.html", "about this book", " about this book This book is a collection of readings and other resources for use in the Science or Superstition course I teach at Plymouth State University. This version is a result of a long evolution which began a number of years ago on various blogging platforms (B2evolution and then WordPress) and has steadily been moving towards a simpler version less dependant on all of the bells and whistles of dynamically generated web pages towards cleaner and faster to load static webpages. This version is, I hope, easier to use (and maintain) as well as less prone to technical difficulties. There are no databases, no plugins to add functions and much less overhead. It is hosted on GitHub pages and the source code is available in its repository in case anyone wants to use it for their own purposes.

["revolution.html", "The scientific revolution", " The scientific revolution The scientific revolution was a far-reaching transformation of our understanding of the natural world as well as a transformation of the methods we could use to gather knowledge about the world. It can be conveniently framed by the publication of two books, even if its roots go further back that the first and it continued long after the second. The first of these is On the revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres written by Nicolas Copernicus and published shortly after his death in 1543. And the second is Isaac Newton’s Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy first published in 1687. Paul Hermans [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons The first of these presented a clear and deliberate argument against the view that the earth is the stable center of the universe with the sun the planets and the stars all orbiting around us. The second articulated a simple set of mathematical laws governing all motion on earth and in the heavens. It made use of the novel mathematical techniques and principles now known as calculus to describe with mathematical precision the continuous change of variables in such phenomena as the orbits of the planets and the motion of projectiles here in earth. These two books represent convenient beginning and end points for a series of developments that transformed our conception of the universe and our place in it. The image below has embedded within it videos and web links to find out more about Copernicus, Newton and many of the other important contributors whose lives and work unfolded between these two. "],

["matter-and-energy.html", "Matter and energy", " Matter and energy In the beginning of the Nineteenth Century, that is after the Scientific Revolution, the scientific understanding of the material world was just getting started. At that point the following questions had not yet been answered: What exactly are material things made of? What causes matter to change form – why do things rust, burn, transform chemically? What explains the mysterious phenomena of electricity and magnetism? What is heat, why do some processes release heat and how can it be harnessed to do interesting things? What is the difference between animate and inanimate things? By the end of the century all of these questions had been answered, even though the details had not yet all been worked out. But not only did this vast increase in knowledge lead to a great understanding of the material world, it was also accompanied by, led to and was helped out by a vast change in human society known as the Industrial Revolution. As compelling evidence of the scope of theses changes consider Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at the beginning and at the end of the century. Before the scientific and technological changes of the Nineteenth Century Pittsburgh was a sleepy frontier town at the confluence of three rivers. View of the City of Pittsburgh in 1817 by Mrs. E. C. Gibson &amp; William Coventry Wall Less than a century later the small frontier town had grown into an industrial city at the heart of the American steel industry. Pittsburgh in 1902 by Thaddeus Mortimer Fowler Underneath this transformation into the world of modern industrial society in which we still all live was a series of scientific developments in the understanding and hence ability to manipulate the material world as never before.

["freedom-and-determinism.html", "Freedom and determinism", " Freedom and determinism Our next philosophical interlude is an exploration of the difficult puzzle of human freedom in a material world. The problem is simple to state and maddeningly difficult to solve. If everything that happens in the material world is caused by physical forces acting according to necessary laws, how can we really do anything freely? Are we not just cogs in some vast machine compelled by the forces acting on us? "],
["science-and-pseudoscience.html", "Science and pseudoscience", " Science and pseudoscience The nineteenth century not only saw the explosive growth of scientific and technical knowledge about the workings of the material world. It also saw the development of modern spiritualism, phrenology (which claimed to be able to determine the character traits of someone based on the shape of their head), the the “science” of human racial types, hypnotism, parapsychology, modern astrology and other not-quite-scientific attempts to provide a scientific basis for a picture of the world that was directly threatened by the materialism implicit in nineteenth century science. What all of these approaches have in common is the attempt to use quasi-scientific methods to validate beliefs that were directly threatened by developments in science. From a philosophical point of view, we are here wandering into the murky waters of the “demarcation problem.” How can we distinguish “real” science from pseudo-scientific impostors, those approaches that claim to be scientific but are really something different? The difficulty of this problem comes from the difficulty of spelling out a series of necessary and sufficient conditions for something being real science, especially since the pretenders to science often argue that their views meet those same criteria. Is this just a matter of turf wars between the establishment and the fringe? Is this really an ideological battle between two different world views one of which claims that all that exists is matter and energy, and the other of which claims that there has to be something more – a soul, a spiritual world, a deeper and hidden meaning to things rather than just atoms in empty space? This article presents the basic question and discusses Karl Popper’s famous solution to the “demarcation problem” which hinges on his idea that the best scientific theories are not the ones that have been somehow proven correct or verified, but the ones that could be but have not yet been falsified. That may seem like a roundabout way of talking but for Popper the crucial difference between legitimate and illegitimate approaches to science is that scientific claims take risks and so tells us something new about reality while pseudosceintific theories do not and hence never get beyond stating what their proponents already think they know. What Is Pseudoscience? Climate deniers are accused of practicing pseudoscience, as are intelligent design creationists, astrologers, UFOlogists, parapsychologists, practitioners of alternative medicine, and often anyone who strays far from the scientific mainstream. Here is another take on the topic by Hank Green from the Crash Course video series. "],
