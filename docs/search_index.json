["about-this-book.html", "about this book", " about this book This book is a collection of readings and other resources for use in the Science or Superstition course I teach at Plymouth State University. This version is a result of a long evolution which began a number of years ago on various blogging platforms (B2evolution and then WordPress) and has steadily been moving towards a simpler version less dependant on all of the bells and whistles of dynamically generated web pages towards cleaner and faster to load static webpages. This version is, I hope, easier to use (and maintain) as well as less prone to technical difficulties. There are no databases, no plugins to add functions and much less overhead. It is hosted on GitHub pages and the source code is available in its repository in case anyone wants to use it for their own purposes.

He visited, among other locations, Oklahoma City, Waco, New Orleans, and Virginia Tech, spreading a message of peace and love at the sites of tragic events.

["matter-and-energy.html", "Matter and energy", " Matter and energy In the beginning of the Nineteenth Century, that is after the Scientific Revolution, the scientific understanding of the material world was just getting started. At that point the following questions had not yet been answered: What exactly are material things made of? What causes matter to change form – why do things rust, burn, transform chemically? What explains the mysterious phenomena of electricity and magnetism? What is heat, why do some processes release heat and how can it be harnessed to do interesting things? What is the difference between animate and inanimate things? By the end of the century all of these questions had been answered, even though the details had not yet all been worked out. But not only did this vast increase in knowledge lead to a great understanding of the material world, it was also accompanied by, led to and was helped out by a vast change in human society known as the Industrial Revolution. As compelling evidence of the scope of theses changes consider Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at the beginning and at the end of the century. Before the scientific and technolgical changes of the Nineteenth Century Pittsburgh was a sleepy frontier town at the confluence of three rivers. View of the City of Pittsburgh in 1817 by Mrs. E. C. Gibson &amp; William Coventry Wall Less than a century later the small frotier town had grown into an industrial city at teh heart of the American steel industry. Pittsburgh in 1902 by Thaddeus Mortimer Fowler Underneath this transformation into the world of modern industrial society in which we still all live was a series of scientific developments in the understanding and hence ability to manipulate the material world as never before.
