## Blog grading guidelines {#blog-grades}

- Each post is worth 10 points out of the 100 points possible in the course.
- A 10 point post is one that is about the right length, uses images appropriately (Creative Commons or public domain images, with sources mentioned if necessary), has clickable links to other pages (if you include them) not just raw URL's, and above all is written with care and with a clear storyline in your own voice.
- Points will be subtracted for:
   + careless, underdeveloped and unclear writing
   + uncited image sources, or use of copyright protected material
   + raw URL's in any links
   + plagiarized writing -- this assignment is not about learning how to copy and paste
   + missing deadlines as listed on the [calendar](#calendar)
